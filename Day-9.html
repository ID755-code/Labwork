        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Database Design and Implementation: DBAs design and implement database structures based on organizational requirements. This involves understanding data relationships, ensuring efficient data storage, and supporting effective data retrieval and manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Security Management: DBAs are responsible for safeguarding databases against unauthorized access and breaches. This includes setting up user roles, managing permissions, implementing encryption, and monitoring access logs for suspicious activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Performance Tuning and Optimization: DBAs monitor and optimize database performance by analyzing metrics such as query execution times, resource usage, and disk I/O. They adjust database schemas, queries, and indexing strategies to enhance performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Backup and Recovery: DBAs implement and manage backup and recovery strategies to protect data from loss due to hardware failures, disasters, or human errors. Regular backups and testing ensure data can be restored quickly and accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Database Maintenance: DBAs perform routine maintenance tasks, including database updates, patching, and reorganization of data to improve efficiency and security.
            </li>
        </ul>

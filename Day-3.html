        <p><b>Data:</b><br>
            Raw facts and figures that have not yet been processed to reveal their meaning. Data can be numerical, textual, or even multimedia. In its raw form, it is not very useful until it is processed and converted into information. Examples include a list of temperatures or sales figures.
        </p>
        <p><b>Information:</b><br>
            Data that has been processed and given context, making it meaningful and useful. Information is data that has been organized in a way that provides value or insight. For instance, the average temperature for a week or a sales report for a specific period.
        </p>
        <p><b>Metadata:</b><br>
            Data about data. Metadata provides information about other data, such as its structure, format, and meaning. It helps in understanding and using the data effectively. Examples include the author of a document, the date it was created, or the file type and size.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data Dictionary:</b><br>
            A centralized repository that contains definitions and descriptions of data elements in a database. The data dictionary includes information such as data types, relationships between data elements, and constraints. It is crucial for data management and ensures consistency and understanding of data across an organization.
        </p>
        <p><b>Database:</b><br>
            A structured collection of data stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) and are designed to store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data efficiently. Examples of databases include customer records, financial records, and product inventories.
        </p>
        <p><b>Table:</b><br>
            A collection of related data entries in a database, organized in rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a data field within the record. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of a database, and they store data in a structured format. For example, a table might store customer information with columns for customer ID, name, address, and phone number.
        </p>
        <p><b>Tuple(s):</b><br>
            A single row in a table, representing a single record. Each tuple contains a specific set of values that correspond to the fields in the table. For example, in a customer table, a tuple would include values for customer ID, name, address, and phone number for one customer.
        </p>
        <p><b>Field(s):</b><br>
            A single column in a table, representing a specific type of data. Each field contains a specific piece of information within a record. For instance, in a table of customer information, fields might include customer ID, name, address, and phone number.
        </p>
        <p><b>Domain:</b><br>
            The set of possible values that a field (or attribute) can hold. Domains define the permissible values for a given attribute and ensure data integrity. For example, the domain for a field representing age might be restricted to integer values between 0 and 120.
        </p>
        <p><b>Constraint(s):</b><br>
            Rules enforced on data columns in a table to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Constraints can be used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. Common types of constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and not null constraints.
        </p>
        <p><b>Key(s):</b><br>
            Attributes or sets of attributes that are used to uniquely identify records in a table. The most common types of keys are primary keys and foreign keys. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables. For example, a customer ID might be a primary key in a customer table and a foreign key in an orders table.
